<!-- Include this step if using an oven, and bold the temperature, e.g., **200°C / Gas Mark 6** -->
<!-- ### **Preheat the oven:**
Set your oven to the required temperature. -->

### **Make the spicy pesto aioli:**
In a small bowl, stir together the pesto, mayonnaise, chili crunch, honey, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until it’s time to assemble the sandwiches.

### **Prepare the tuna mixture:**
Place the tuna, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon zest and juice, garlic cloves, capers, anchovy paste, and dill in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on high until smooth and an almost “whipped” consistency is achieved, stopping as needed to scrape down the sides of the food processor, about 1 minute.

### **Add onions and seasoning:**
Stir in the chopped onions, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning as desired.

### **Toast the bread:**
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high, then add 2 pieces of bread at a time, cut side-down. Weigh down using a small skillet or pot and cook until the pieces are golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet (just brown the interior of the bread) and toast the remaining 2 slices.

### **Assemble the sandwiches:**
Divide and spread the spicy pesto aioli over the toasted side of each piece of bread. Divide and spread the tuna mixture across two pieces of the bread. Then layer each tuna-topped piece of bread with 2 slices of tomato and as much avocado as desired. Top with banana peppers for a slightly spicy-briney punch, if desired. Close sandwiches, slice in half, and serve.

  ### Tips
  - **Important Tip:** Make the tuna mixture as smooth and spreadable as you like by tweaking the amount of mayo you add.
  - **Bread Slicing:** If using focaccia, slice it widthwise into thin slices. A good bread knife will help with this.
  - **Crispy Bread:** Take your time toasting the bread to make sure it's nice and browned.
  - **Make Ahead:** The pesto and tuna mixture can be made up to 3 days in advance. For the tuna mixture, wait to add the onions until right before serving as their flavor can overwhelm everything else if allowed to sit.
