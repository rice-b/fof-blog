### For the chicken wings
- **6 chicken wings**, cut in half to drumstick and winglet
- **1 lemon**, *half thinly sliced for marinade, juice of remaining half for serving*

### For the marinade
- **3 garlic cloves**, *peeled and smashed*
- **1 tsp sea salt**
- **A generous pinch freshly ground black pepper**
- **1 tbsp wholegrain mustard**
- **1 tbsp dijon mustard**
- **1 heaped tsp honey**
- **1 tbsp olive oil**

### For the baby potatoes
- **1 bag small baby potatoes** (the ratte variety work beautifully here, but any small ones will do)
- **2 tbsp olive oil** (for frying)

### For the harissa yoghurt
- **3 tbsp yoghurt**
- **1 tsp harissa**

### To serve
- **A few parsley or celery leaves**, *picked*

<!-- Include this step if using an oven, and bold the temperature, e.g., **200°C / Gas Mark 6** -->
<!-- ### **Preheat the oven:**
Set your oven to the required temperature. -->

### **Prepare the wings:**
Put the cut wing halves in a bowl. Cut the lemon in half, and set one half aside. Cut the remaining half-lemon into quarters, then thinly slice it and add to the wings bowl. Add all the marinade ingredients to the bowl, mix to coat and set aside for at least an hour or so and up to 48 hours.

### **Cook the wings:**
Heat the air fryer to **200°C** for three minutes. Tip all the wings and the marinade into the crisper tray and set the timer for 12 minutes. Once the time is up, lift the tray out of the air fryer, give it a good shake so the wings turn and to ensure they color all over, then return to the fryer for another five minutes. *The wings should be golden brown and crispy.*

### **Cook the potatoes:**
Transfer the wings to a bowl and cover, then put the potatoes into the air fryer – there is no need to add anything else because the tray will have all the juices from cooking the wings. Cook for 10 minutes, still at **200°C**, then return the wings to the tray, laying them on top of the potatoes. Cook for a final four minutes, so everything is nice and hot. *The potatoes should be tender and the wings hot.*

### **Prepare the yoghurt:**
Meanwhile, mix the yoghurt with the harissa.

### **Serve:**
Plate up the wings and potatoes, squeeze the juice of the reserved half-lemon over the wings, then scatter the parsley or celery over the lot and serve.
