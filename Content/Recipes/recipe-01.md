- **2 tbsp butter**
- **Salt**
- **Pepper**
- **Olive oil**

### For the chimichurri

<!-- Include this step if using an oven, and bold the temperature, e.g., **200°C / Gas Mark 6** -->
<!-- ### **Preheat the oven:**
Set your oven to the required temperature. -->

### **Make the chimichurri:**
Finely chop the fresh herbs, then add to a mixing bowl. Finely dice the chilli, mince the garlic and add to the herbs with the vinegar. Season to taste, then stream in the olive oil whilst mixing until thoroughly combined. Set aside.

### **Prepare the butter bean purée:**
Pour the butter beans into a blender with the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, 1 garlic clove, and nutritional yeast. Blend until smooth.

### **Prepare the cauliflower steaks:**
Chop the cauliflower into steaks - you should be able to get two from the middle of a large one. Save the extra florets for another recipe, or roast with salt, pepper, paprika, and olive oil to serve alongside the steaks. Chop up the leaves and stems and set aside for a zero-waste garnish.

### **Season the cauliflower:**
Season the steaks with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides, then drizzle with oil and massage well.

### **Cook the cauliflower steaks:**
Heat a frying pan to medium high. Add 2 tbsp olive oil. Once hot, add the steak - press down to sear. After several minutes, flip and fry the other side until golden brown. Bash the garlic cloves, add with the butter and baste continuously. *The steaks should be golden brown and crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside.*

### **Serve:**
Pour the butter bean purée into the middle of a plate. Place the steak on top, drizzle with chimichurri and scatter over the cauliflower leaves.
