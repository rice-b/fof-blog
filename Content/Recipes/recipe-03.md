<!-- Include this step if using an oven, and bold the temperature, e.g., **200°C / Gas Mark 6** -->
<!-- ### **Preheat the oven:**

### **Cook the lentils:**
Rinse the lentils under cold water. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and diced carrot. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until softened. Stir in the ground cumin, coriander, and turmeric, and cook for another minute. Add the lentils and vegetable stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30-35 minutes, until the lentils are tender. *The lentils should be tender but not mushy.*

### **Make the pomegranate molasses dressing:**
In a small bowl, whisk together the pomegranate molasses, olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Set aside.

### **Prepare the lemon tahini sauce:**
In another bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, and salt. Gradually add water until you reach a smooth, pourable consistency.

### **Serve:**
Spoon the cooked lentils onto plates. Drizzle with the pomegranate molasses dressing and the lemon tahini sauce. Garnish with pomegranate seeds and chopped fresh parsley.
