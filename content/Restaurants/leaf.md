## Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven:** Set your oven to the required temperature.
2. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. **Doneness:** The pasta should be firm to the bite. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.
3. **Prepare the pancetta:** While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. **Doneness:** The pancetta should be golden brown and crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. **Make the sauce:** In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Add a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper.
5. **Combine:** Return the skillet with pancetta to low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. **Doneness:** The garlic should be golden and aromatic. Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet and toss to combine.
6. **Add the egg mixture:** Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. **Doneness:** The sauce should be creamy and smooth, without scrambling the eggs. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water until you reach the desired consistency.
7. **Serve:** Divide the pasta among plates and garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Serve immediately with extra grated Parmesan on the side.
